- E-mail
	- User Agents
		- 'mail reader'
		- allows you to compose, edit, and read emails
		- e.g. Outlook, Gmail
	- Mail Servers
		- mailbox - contains incoming messages for user
		- message queue - outgoing mail messages
	- Email Protocols
		- SMTP protocol
			- Uses TCP
			- Port 25
			- Phases
				- handshaking
				- transfer of messages
				- closure
			- messages are stored as 7-bit ASCII text
			- Example
				1. Alice uses her User Agent to compose and send an email to bo\b@someschool.edu
				2. Alice's US sends the message to her mail server, it is stored in the message queue
				3. Alice's mail server opens TCP connection with Bob's mail server
				4. SMTP client sends the message over the connection
				5. Bob's mail server places the message in Bob's mailbox
				6. Bob uses his User Agent to read the email

		- POP3 or IMAP deals with the retrieval and deletion of stored messages
			- this is because servers are always running while the recieving client may not be
		- HTTP provides a web based interface
- DNS
	- provides a way to map URLs to IP addresses
	- There's a distributed database all around the world
		- *Different companies have name servers, like your ISP, big companies like google have a name server for all their own URLs. There are also 13 root servers operated by several different companies like ICANN and US Army. DNS requests will jump through layers, cache, ISP all the way up to root servers*
	- application-layer protocol - resolves names
	- DNS services
		- hostname to IP address translation
		- host aliasing - One IP, multiple host names
		- mail server aliasing
		- load distribution - One host name, many IP
	- Why not centralise?
		- single point of failure
		- traffic volume
		- distance
		- servers go down for maintenance sometimes
		- doesn't scale - e.g. Comcast DNS servers take 600 Billion queries a day
	![[Pasted image 20240311122907.png]]
			1. Root
			2. Top Level Domain
			3. Authoritative
	- Root servers
		- 13 root servers, with many copies
		- incredibly important
		- provides authentication and message integrity
		- ICANN manages root DNS domains
	- TLD
		- Top-Level Domain servers
		- e.g. .com, .org, .net
	- Authoritative
		- IP mappings for an organisation's host names
		- e.g. Google's DNS server will map google.com and youtube.com
	- Local DNS name servers
		- Does not strictly belong to hierarchy
		- each ISP, company and university has one
		- acts as a proxy
		- caches recent mappings used
	- Example
		1. Host asks local DNS server
		2. Local DNS server doesn't have mapping, asks root server
		3. Root server gives the TLD server
		4. Local DNS asks TLD server
		5. TLD server gives authoritative server
		6. Local DNS asks authoritative server
		7. Authoritative server gives mapping
		8. Local DNS gives mapping to Host
- Socket programming

## UDP
### Server Code
```python
from socket import *
serverPort = 12000
serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
serverSocket.bind((””, serverPort))
print("The server is ready to receive")
while True:
	message, clientAddress = serverSocket.recvfrom(2048)
	modifiedMessage = message.decode().upper()
	serverSocket.sendto(modifiedMessage.encode(), clientAddress)
```

1. `from socket import *`: This line imports all functions and classes from the `socket` module. The `socket` module provides low-level networking interfaces.
2. `serverPort = 12000`: This line defines the port number on which the server will listen for incoming messages. Port 12000 is chosen in this case, but it could be any available port number.
3. `serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)`: This line creates a new socket object for the server. The `AF_INET` parameter specifies that the socket will use IPv4 addressing, and `SOCK_DGRAM` specifies that the socket will be a UDP socket, which is a connectionless, datagram-oriented protocol.
4. `serverSocket.bind(("", serverPort))`: This line binds the socket to a specific network interface (`""` means it will bind to all available interfaces) and port number (`serverPort`). This prepares the socket to receive incoming datagrams sent to the specified port.
5. `print("The server is ready to receive")`: This line simply prints a message indicating that the server is ready to receive incoming messages.
6. `while True:`: This line starts an infinite loop, ensuring that the server will continuously listen for incoming messages.
7. `message, clientAddress = serverSocket.recvfrom(2048)`: This line waits to receive a message on the socket. The `recvfrom()` method blocks until it receives a message. When a message arrives, it returns two values: the message itself and the address of the client who sent the message.
8. `modifiedMessage = message.decode().upper()`: This line decodes the received message from bytes to a string using the `decode()` method and then converts it to uppercase using the `upper()` method. This will modify the received message to be in uppercase.
9. `serverSocket.sendto(modifiedMessage.encode(), clientAddress)`: This line sends the modified message back to the client. It first encodes the modified message from a string to bytes using the `encode()` method and then sends it to the address (`clientAddress`) from which the original message was received.

### Client Code
```python
from socket import *
serverName = '192.168.0.20'
serverPort = 12000
clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
message = input('Input lowercase sentence:')
clientSocket.sendto(message.encode(), (serverName, serverPort))
modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)
print(modifiedMessage.decode())
clientSocket.close()
```

1. `from socket import *`: Imports all functions and classes from the `socket` module.
2. `serverName = '192.168.0.20'`: Sets the IP address of the server to which the client will send messages.
3. `serverPort = 12000`: Sets the port number on which the server is listening for incoming messages.
4. `clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)`: Creates a new socket object for the client. It uses IPv4 addressing (`AF_INET`) and UDP protocol (`SOCK_DGRAM`).
5. `message = input('Input lowercase sentence:')`: Prompts the user to input a lowercase sentence. This message will be sent to the server.
6. `clientSocket.sendto(message.encode(), (serverName, serverPort))`: Encodes the message string into bytes using the `encode()` method and sends it to the server specified by `serverName` and `serverPort`.
7. `modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)`: Waits to receive a response from the server. When a response is received, it stores the modified message in `modifiedMessage` and the server's address in `serverAddress`.
8. `print(modifiedMessage.decode())`: Decodes the modified message from bytes to a string using the `decode()` method and prints it to the console.
9. `clientSocket.close()`: Closes the socket connection once the communication is complete.

# TCP
### Server Code
```python
from socket import * 
serverPort = 12000 
serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) 
serverSocket.bind((””, serverPort)) 
serverSocket.listen(1) 
print("The server is ready to receive") 
while True: 
	connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept() 
	sentence = connectionSocket.recv(1024).decode() 
	capitalizedSentence = sentence.upper() 
	connectionSocket.send(capitalizedSentence.encode()) 
	connectionSocket.close()
```

1. `from socket import *`: This line imports all symbols from the `socket` module, allowing us to use its classes and functions without prefixing them with `socket.`.
2. `serverPort = 12000`: Defines the port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections.
3. `serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)`: Creates a socket object for the server. `AF_INET` specifies the address family (IPv4), and `SOCK_STREAM` indicates the socket type (TCP).
4. `serverSocket.bind(("", serverPort))`: Binds the server socket to a specific address (`""` means all available interfaces) and port number (`serverPort`).
5. `serverSocket.listen(1)`: Sets the server to listen for incoming connections. The argument `1` specifies the maximum number of queued connections.
6. `print("The server is ready to receive")`: Prints a message indicating that the server is ready to accept connections.
7. `while True:`: Starts an infinite loop to continuously accept incoming connections.
8. `connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()`: Accepts an incoming connection from a client. It blocks until a connection is established, returning a new socket (`connectionSocket`) for communicating with the client and the client's address (`addr`).
9. `sentence = connectionSocket.recv(1024).decode()`: Receives data from the client through the `connectionSocket`. It waits until data is received, with a maximum buffer size of 1024 bytes. The received data is then decoded into a string assuming it's in UTF-8 encoding.
10. `capitalizedSentence = sentence.upper()`: Converts the received sentence to uppercase.
11. `connectionSocket.send(capitalizedSentence.encode())`: Sends the modified (capitalized) sentence back to the client after encoding it into bytes.
12. `connectionSocket.close()`: Closes the connection socket with the current client, releasing the associated resources. The server remains running and continues to accept connections from other clients.

### Client Code
```python
from socket import * 
serverName = '192.168.0.20' 
serverPort = 12000 
clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) 
clientSocket.connect((serverName, serverPort)) 
sentence = input('Input a lower case sentence : ') 
clientSocket.send(sentence.encode()) 
modifiedSentence = clientSocket.recv(1024) 
print('From Server : ' + modifiedSentence.decode()) 
clientSocket.close()
```

1. `from socket import *`: Imports all symbols from the `socket` module for usage without prefixing them with `socket.`.
2. `serverName = '192.168.0.20'`: Defines the IP address or hostname of the server to which the client will connect.
3. `serverPort = 12000`: Specifies the port number on which the server is listening for incoming connections.
4. `clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)`: Creates a socket object for the client. `AF_INET` indicates the address family (IPv4), and `SOCK_STREAM` specifies the socket type (TCP).
5. `clientSocket.connect((serverName, serverPort))`: Initiates a connection to the server specified by `serverName` and `serverPort`.
6. `sentence = input('Input a lower case sentence : ')`: Prompts the user to input a lowercase sentence.
7. `clientSocket.send(sentence.encode())`: Sends the input sentence to the server after encoding it into bytes.
8. `modifiedSentence = clientSocket.recv(1024)`: Receives the modified (capitalized) sentence from the server. It waits until data is received, with a maximum buffer size of 1024 bytes.
9. `print('From Server : ' + modifiedSentence.decode())`: Prints the modified sentence received from the server after decoding it from bytes to a string.
10. `clientSocket.close()`: Closes the connection socket with the server, releasing the associated resources.
