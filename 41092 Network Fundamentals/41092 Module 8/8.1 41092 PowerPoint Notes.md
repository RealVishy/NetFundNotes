IP addresses
- You can manually configure an IP on a network or
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	- Hosts will automatically be assigned IP address
	- This allows for addresses to not be in use when a device disconnects
	- Protocol handshake
		- discover
			- uses broadcast address to ask for a DHCP server
			- This request is sent from the network address
		- offer
			- DHCP server will send a packet to the broadcast address
			- This message includes an available IP address, subnet mask, lease duration, and server IP
			- Sent to broadcast address
		- request
			- This message is used to formally request the offered IP address
				- note that there can be multiple DHCP servers, so the device may get multiple offers
				- The device will chose one then send this request
			- This request is still sent on the broadcast address
		- ack
			- acknowledgement of the leased IP address
			- In the case that there are multiple DHCP servers
				- there is the IP of the DHCP server that sent the offer the device accepted
				- this DHCP is the one to send the ack
				- all others will return the offered IP address back into the pool of addresses
			- This packet is sent to broadcast address
	- DHCP servers tend to be built within a router
	- DHCP servers return
		- Network mask
		- First hop router for clients
		- IP address of DNS server
	- *Multiple DHCP servers (NOT IN THE POWERPOINT)*
		- *IP ranges*
			- *Separate IP ranges (recommended)*
				- *each server uses a different pool of IP ranges*
			- *Same IP range*
				- *each server uses the same range*
		- *Communication*
			- *Usually no direct communication, relying on listening to broadcast address*
			- *Though there is the DHCP Failover Protocol*
				- *this allows DHCP servers to have direct communication with each other*
			- *External tools*
				- *things like databases can be used for large networks*

This is all within a local network ^^^
- when you see 192.168.x.x, this address is local
- so giving someone else that address on a different network will not work
	- they will just connect to whatever device in their network has that address (or connect to nothing)

Allocating internet wide IP addresses
- ISPs provide a network with an identifying IP address
	- these tend to be dynamic as well
	- for businesses or otherwise, they can be set to be static
- ISPs get their IP addresses from ICANN
- Internet Corporation for Assigned Name and Numbers

IP routing forwarding
- Forwarding in a host
	- Basically if you're sending a packet from an IP to that same IP, not routing or forwarding is needed
- Forwarding in a Router
	- Forwarding tables contain a destination address range, the outgoing interface and the next hop
		- an outgoing interface is just what physical interface the router will use e.g. WAN port
	- When a packet is received by a router, it compares the dest. address with this table
		- it then sends it to the next hop
	- Hierarchical addressing
		- A way of organising IP addresses to reflect logical structure and topology
		- RIR - Regional Internet Registries
			- continents get large blocks of IPs to use
		- ISPs
			- get smaller blocks from RIRs
			- allocate even smaller blocks to smaller ISPs
			- allocate IPs to customers
		- Allows for geological allocation of blocks of IPs
		- What does this mean for routing and forwarding?
			- When matching a destination IP to an element in the table
			- routing protocols can use longest address prefix
			- e.g. Dest. IP: 223.14.2.1, table entries of 223.14.0.0/16 and 223.14.2.0/24
				- The routing protocol would chose the latter
				- which would roughly mean a smaller geological area

We are out of IP addresses
- The IPv4 standard is 32-bit
- total amount of addresses is $2^{32}$
- This is less than 4.3 billion
- NAT is the technique we use to help alleviate this problem 
	- tho it's like using duct-tape to fix a building about to collapse
- IPv6 is the new version, though the prevalence of IPv4 means we are very slow to adopt
	- 128-bit addresses
	- $\frac{\text{number of IPv4 addresses}}{\text{number of IPv6 addresses}}=0.0000000000000000000000001\text{\%}$ 

Network Address Translation
- All devices on a network share one public IP
- Private network ranges are
	- 10.0.0.0/8
	- 172.16.0.0/12
	- 198.162.0.0/16
- advantages
	- less use of IPv4 address space
	- can change local device IPs without notifying internet
	- can change ISP without notifying devices across network
- In practice
	- Routers will dynamically assign sockets and devices to ports
		- this is how the router differentiates between what devices incoming packets should be sent to
	- Outgoing datagrams
		- replace source IP with public IP
		- replace source port with a new port
		- store the source IP/Port and public IP/port pair in a table
	- Incoming datagrams
		- use table to replace destination IP and port
- Controversy
	- Violates end-to-end principle
		- the principle states that packets should be sent between devices with no intermediate interference
	- Complexity
		- Adds complexity issues
		- slows processing time in routers
	- Security
		- can provide a false sense of security
		- there are attacks for NAT like NAT traversal
	- Scalability
		- large scale networks can feel the affect of this limit on how many devices can connect to a network
	- Interoperability
		- issues surrounding protocols with embed IP addresses i.e. SIP used for VOIP
		- STUN is used to work around this issue

IPv6
- Advantages
	- Much larger IP address space
	- Simplified heading, removing headers that complicate processing
	- Support of IPsec, improves overall security
	- Better QoS, allows for better prioritisation
	- SLAAC removes the need for DHCP as devices can configure their own address
	- (whatever isn't in the slideshow isn't really needed, just thought I'd add some stuff)
- Disadvantages
	- Increased header size
		- 40 bytes compared to IPv4 20 bytes
		- reduce network efficiency
	- Fragmentation
		- routers can't fragment packets
		- devices need to fragment their own packets
	- Transition
		- transitioning to IPv6 is a very complex issue
	- No checksum
- Tunnelling
	- The protocols for dealing with communication over networks with both IPv6, IPv4 and devices that are capable of both
	- 6in4
		- the process of encapsulating an IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet
	- 6to4
		- the automatic use of the 6in4
	- in practice
		- Say I want to send a packet from A to F, though there are IPv4 routers in between my A and F which have no support for IPv4
			1. I will send an IPv6 packet with a source of A and a destination of F
			2. Assume B supports both IPv6 and IPv4, when B gets my packet it encapsulates my IPv6 packet within an IPv4 packet. This IPv4 packet will have a source of B and a destination of E
			3. C, which is purely IPv4, can now read my packet
			4. So can D
			5. And now it gets to E, which supports both IPv4 and IPv6, this router will remove the encapsulation and send this IPv6 packet to F
			6. F gets the packet as though it never went through any IPv4 router
	- Adoption
		- Google says that 30% of connections to their services use IPv6
		- NIST states that 1/3 of all government domains are IPv6
		- IPv6 was created in 1998, it's existed for 26 years
			- So why is it taking so long to adopt?
			- Because we still need to support older devices and standard as to not break any important systems
			- Governments are especially slow to adopt standards
			- i.e. DOE has only recently updates parts of their system, though some parts still use old systems
