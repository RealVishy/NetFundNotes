## Network Layer
- Key Network Layer Functions
	- Routing
		- determining what route the packet should take
	- Forwarding
		- move packet from input to appropriate output
- Data Plane
	- determines how datagram should be forwarded
	- based on pre-determined forwarding
- Control Plane
	- Determines how datagram is moved along routers
	- network-wide logic
	- based on network topology
	- two approaches
		- traditional routing algorithms
			- implemented in routers
			- each routers have their forwarding tables and routing logic
		- software-defined networking (SDN)
			- implemented in remote servers
			- these servers perform the task of computing individual forwarding tables
			- separates forwarding and routing
- Network Layer Service Model
	- The internet is what's known as a best effort model
	- This model provides no guarantee of delivery
		- successful delivery
		- timing or order
		- bandwidth
	- This has allowed a wide deployment of the internet
	- performance is good enough most of the time
	- Something that helps with this model is a distributed application, think about how google has servers all over the world. Their websites are distributed
	- Services that can adjust bandwidth restrictions helps congestion control, think YouTube quality selector
## Inside a router
- A router is made up of four main "parts"
	- Processor for routing
		- Just like a computer processor
		- it runs the protocols for routing
		- maintains routing tables
		- controls different parts of the router
	- Input ports
		- receive datagrams from other networks
		- destination based forwarding
			- forward based on destination IP
	- Switching fabric
		- If the switching fabric is slower than the bandwidth of the input ports, then queueing and loss will occur
		- transfer packet from input to output port
		- switching rate
			- rate at which packets can go from input to output
			- often measured as a multiple of line rate
			- $\text{Numbers of lines}\times\text{Rate}$
			- 3 types
				- memory
					- copies packet to system memory
					- then sends it to output port
				- bus
					- shared wires connecting all ports
					- ports then accept or reject packets
					- if multiple packets want to be sent at once, multiplexing is used i.e. TDM
					- switching speed is limited by speed
				- interconnection network
					- basically like a mini version of the internet
					- many different switching elements that are connected in a certain way
					- we have different ways of connecting them
					- this allows for parallel transfer to occur as packets can be divided into paths that don't intersect
	- Output ports
		- they receive datagrams
		- Buffering happens when switching rate exceeds output line speed
		- there are protocols for buffering, scheduling disciplines and policies on what datagrams should be dropped if needed
		- packet scheduling - what packet should be sent next
			- first come first served (FCFS)
				- packets that come first, are outputted first
				- FIFO
			- priority
				- traffic is queued by class
				- sends priority class first then goes to the next priority level
				- FCFS within priority class
			- round robin (RR)
				- queue by class
				- sends one from every priority
			- weighted fair queueing (WFQ)
				- generalised RR
				- each class gets a weight
				- amount of packets processed from each queue is proportional to it's weight
				- things like large file transfers, real-time voice or video may get a higher weight to account for the need of higher bandwidth
				- Service Level Agreements also affect weighting
		- Buffer Management
			- which packets should be dropped
			- tail-drop
				- drop anything that's incoming after buffer is filled
			- priority
				- drop based on priority
## Network Neutrality
Net neutrality is about how ISPs are legally allowed to allocate resources 
i.e. packet scheduling, buffer management
It ensures a few things
- no blocking
- no throttling
- no paid prioritisation
of internet services
Basically, makes sure no services are prioritised while others are throttled i.e. say if Google Fibre made Youtube run significantly better and throttles Twitch.

## IP
### datagram
![[TCP and IP overhead.png]]

IP Header Format: The IP header has a fixed size of 20 bytes (for IPv4) and consists of several fields. Here are the key fields in the IP header:

1. Version (4 bits): Indicates the IP protocol version (IPv4 or IPv6).
2. Header Length (4 bits): Specifies the length of the header in 4-byte words.
3. Type of Service (8 bits): Provides information about the desired quality of service (QoS) for the datagram.
4. Total Length (16 bits): Indicates the total length of the IP datagram, including the header and payload, in bytes.
5. Identification (16 bits): Used for reassembling fragmented datagrams.
6. Flags (3 bits): Control flags for fragmentation and other functions.
7. Fragment Offset (13 bits): Specifies the position of a fragmented datagram relative to the original datagram.
8. Time to Live (TTL) (8 bits): Determines the maximum number of hops (routers) the datagram can traverse before being discarded.
9. Protocol (8 bits): Identifies the upper-layer protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP) carried in the payload.
10. Header Checksum (16 bits): Used for error detection in the header.
11. Source IP Address (32 bits): Specifies the IP address of the sending host.
12. Destination IP Address (32 bits): Specifies the IP address of the intended recipient host.
13. Options (variable length): Provides additional functionalities, such as timestamp, record route, and more.

TTL
- Time to live
- if a route exceeds TTL in number of hops, the segment is dropped

### NAT
- IP addresses are a 32-bit identifier associated with each host or router interface
- Interface - the link between the physical medium and the host
	- routers can have many interfaces
	- hosts tend to only have ethernet and wifi
- IP addresses
	- each number in an IP address can go up to 255
	- i.e. 192.168.0.255
	- in binary, 255 is 11111111
	- $256 = 2^8$ you can see how 8 bits makes up 256 possible number, 0-255
- Subnetting
	- A way to logically divide a network into different sub networks
	- These have no affect on physical topology, purely logical
	- Though they do have an affect on routing and forwarding protocols
	- Subnet mask
		- 255.255.255.0/24 is very common subnet mask
			- e.g. 192.168.1.xxx You are most likely common with these numbers
			- /24 tells us how many numbers are at play
				- $2^{32-24}=256$ we would take 32 and minus that 24 off, put it to the 2
				- This tells us how many different addresses there are in this subnet
				- 192.168.1.0 would be the network address, used to identify the subnet
				- 192.168.1.255 would be the broadcast address, used to send a message to all devices in a subnet
				- If we take these two into account we can see there are 254 devices that could be assigned to this subnet
		- There are different classes of subnets

|         | Network Address | Broadcast Address | Subnet Mask   | Shorthand | # of addresses |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Class A | 10.0.0.0        | 10.255.255.255    | 255.0.0.0     | /8        | $2^{24}$       |
| Class B | 127.16.0.0      | 127.16.255.255    | 255.255.0.0   | /16       | $2^{16}$       |
| Class C | 192.168.1.0     | 192.168.1.255     | 255.255.255.0 | /24       | $2^{8}$        |
It's important to note you can also have subnets of different numbers that don't align with 8 bit intervals
i.e
- CIDR
	- the thing that allows the variable length subnets
	- better than the class system
	- basically it's the system I put into my notes

| Network Address | Broadcast Address | Subnet Mask     | Shorthand | # of addresses |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 192.168.1.0     | 192.168.2.255     | 255.255.254.0   | /23       | $2^{9}$        |
| 192.168.1.0     | 192.168.1.127     | 255.255.255.128 | /25       | $2^{7}$        |
The PowerPoint also did not go into what NAT is, which is stupid, I'll summarise what it is
- NAT
	- Network Address Translation
	- IPv4 has less than 4.3 billion IPs that it can assign
	- There's about 15 billion internet connected devices
	- So you can't give an IPv4 address to every device
	- NAT allows your internal network to have the 192.168.0.0/16 range while allowing you to also connect to addresses outside of your network
	- When a packet is sent to another address, it is checked if it is an internal range or external
		- these ranges are assigned and are common
	- NAT also defines how routers allocate ports to different devices
	- So now your 20 devices only take up one IP address
