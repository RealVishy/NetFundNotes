- Request time out is usually due to network boundaries having heightened security and not allowing ping requests
	- They don't want the public IP getting out

| Network Tool           | Parameter    | Function |
| ping                          | google.com  | ICMP      |
| traceroute                | google.com  | ICMP      |
| DNS lookup             | google.com   | DNS       |
| Revers DNS lookup | 8.8.8.8           | PTR (DNS pointer record) |

a) Ping and Traceroute are used to determine response times of the destination and the jump points (respectively). DNS lookup is used to turn human readable addresses into IP addresses. Reverse DNS lookup is used to do the oposite.

	The intercontinental results have a much higher ping as it has to travel a much larger distance. Pinging an IP address in NSW will have delays usually under 50. Even pinging WA will result in a jump to anywhere from 70 to 100ms. Then pinging IPs in other continents, will significantly increase the time.
