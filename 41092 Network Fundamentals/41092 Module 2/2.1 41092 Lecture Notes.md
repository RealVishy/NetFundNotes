### Queueing delay
- when input rate exceeds transmission rate, a queue is created
- calculated by $N\times\frac{L}{R}$ where N is the number of packets
- $D_{\text{nodal}}=d_{\text{proc}}+d_{\text{queue}}+d_{\text{trans}}+d_{\text{prop}}$
	- $d_{\text{proc}}$ - processing delay
	- $d_{\text{queue}}$ - time waiting at router
	- $d_{\text{trans}}$ - transmission delay
	- $d_{\text{prop}}$ - length of physical link over propagation speed (~$2\times10^8$m/sec)
		- $d_{\text{prop}}=\frac{d}{s}$

### Conveyor Analogy

Remember, $d_{\text{trans}}$ is the delay of loading these boxes/packets, onto the conveyor/network.
and $d_{\text{prop}}$ is how long a box/packet takes to traverse the conveyor/network.
Knowing this we can get the end to end delay for the whole scenario of 10 boxes.

- $d_{\text{trans}}$ being 10 seconds means that at second 10, the last box will be being placed onto the conveyor. So at t=10s, the last box is being loaded
- The first box would have started travelling from the instant it was loaded, though it would take 100 seconds for it to travel the whole of the conveyor
- The first box would be reaching the end after the time of the propagation delay passes. By definition it's how long a box would take to reach the end.

- $d_{\text{trans}}$ being 10 seconds means that at $t=10s$, the last box will be being placed onto the conveyor. So at $t=10s$, the last box is being loaded
- The new $d_{\text{prop}}$ would be $\frac{50}{10}$ which would equal $5s$, therefore at 10 seconds, the first box would be at the final destination

- The first box is reaching the destination based on the new $d_{\text{prop}}$ we calculated
- The last box would be loaded at $t=10s$, so it would still be waiting to be loaded at $t=5s$

### Real World
- Traceroute program
	- A program to measure the delay for each router/network it goes along
	- It does this by sending three packets to each router along a route (sends three to show reliability)
	- The router will then send the packet back
	- The program will measure how long this takes
- Packet Queueing delay
	- R: link bandwidth (bps)
	- L: packet length (Bytesâ†’bits) 
	- a: average packet arrival rate (packet/s)
	- Arrival rate: La (bps)
	- Traffic intensity: La/R
		- A measure for the intensity of the traffic
		- Since La is a measure in bps of how fast traffic is being sent to the router, it being greater than R means that there is more traffic going into the router than is going out
- Throughput - end to end bps of a system
	- Instantaneous and average (it can differ due to processing time, interference and packet loss)
	- The throughput of a system is entirely based on the weakest link

### Layers of Networks
- Layering the network stack is very useful for many reasons (trust).
	- It allows us to link similar services/actions together
	- Understanding of relationships between services and layers
	- Allows a systematic approach to troubleshooting
		- e.g. I am having connection issues, I first will check the cable for any damages, then I will check the port, then I will restart my router, so on.
	- If we implement with the layer system, then changing one thing won't affect the rest of the system
		- e.g. I can change from using ethernet to WiFi, and still be able to access all other layers I previously did
	- 

OSI Model:
Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
- Physical - The electricity (or radio waves) being transferred through a medium
- Data Link - The link between the physical layer to the network layer
- Network - IP addressing, routing protocols
- Transport - sending of data and protocols for that, TCP and UDP
There is session and presentation in between but this wasn't mentioned in lecture
- Application - protocols surrounding how the applications work, HTTP, SMTP, etc

- We add information on to the packet about each layer
