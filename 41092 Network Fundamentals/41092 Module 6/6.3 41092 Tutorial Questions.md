**P25. We have said that an application may choose UDP for a transport protocol because UDP offers finer application control (than TCP) of what data is sent in a segment and when.**
	a. Why does an application have more control of what data is sent in a segment?  
	b. Why does an application have more control on when the segment is sent?  

**P27. Host A and B are communicating over a TCP connection. Host B has already received from Host A all bytes up through byte 96. Suppose Host A then sends two segments to Host B back-to-back. The first and the second segments contain 40 and 80 bytes of data, respectively. In the first segment, the sequence number is 97, the source port number is 302, and the destination port number is 80.**  

**Host B sends an acknowledgment whenever it receives a segment from Host A.**  
	a. In the second segment sent from Host A to B, what are the sequence number, source port number, and destination port number?  
	b. If the first segment arrives before the second segment, in the acknowledgment of the first arriving segment, what is the acknowledgment number, the source port number, and the destination port number?  
	c. If the second segment arrives before the first segment, in the acknowledgment of the first arriving segment, what is the acknowledgment number?  
	d. Suppose the two segments sent by A arrive in order at B. The first acknowledgment arrives after the first timeout interval. What is the sequence number of the next segment that A will transmit?  

**P28. Host A and B are directly connected with a 10 Gbps link. There is one TCP connection between the two hosts, and Host A is sending to Host B an enormous file over this connection. Host A can send its application data into its TCP socket at a rate as high as 1 Gbps, but Host B can read out of its TCP receive buffer at a maximum rate of 600 Mbps. Describe the effect of TCP flow control.**

Question 25 pts

In the simple TCP client/server socket programming experiment, the client sends a word 'network' (total 8 bytes, including carriage return), and the server echoes with 'NETWORK', as shown in the figure below. Assume the client has a SendBase of 50, and the server has a SendBase of 90.

Question 310 pts

Host A sends two UDP segments to Server S, one to port 1234 and the other to port 2345. Host B sends one UDP segment to Server S, port 1234. 

1. The server S needs to open how many server sockets, N, to handle the three segments from Hosts A and B?   
    Answer: N =  . note: Please fill in _integer numbers_ only in the blank.
2. Parts of the associated IP addresses and assigned port numbers are shown in the first half of the table below. Suppose Server S will respond to each incoming segment with a reply segment back to the sending client. Please fill in the missing entries.

Question 415 pts

The source Host A is going to send 5KB (5120byte) of data to the destination Host B over an established TCP connection, which has a window size (rwnd) of 4KB (4096byte) and a maximum segment size (MSS) of 1KB (1024byte). Assuming Go-Back-N is used in TCP.

Suppose there are errors in the transmissions. For each of the following independent transmission error cases, please calculate the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions) in order to complete the transmissions of the 5KB data to the destination.

1. Case A. The 2nd segment is corrupted. Other transmissions are fine. What is the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions)?  
    Answer:  
2. Case B. The 2nd segment is correctly received, but the ACK to the 2nd segment is lost. Other transmissions are fine. What is the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions)?  
    Answer:  
3. Case C. The 4th segment is lost. All other transmissions are fine. What is the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions)?  
    Answer:  
4. Case D. The 5th segment is lost. All other transmissions are fine. What is the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions)?  
    Answer:  
5. Case E. The 5th segment is correctly received, but the ACK to the 5th segment is lost. Other transmissions are fine. What is the total number of segments sent out from the source (including retransmissions):
