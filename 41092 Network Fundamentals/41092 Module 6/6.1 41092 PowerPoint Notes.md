# TCP
TCP overview
- Point to point
	- one sender, one receiver
- Reliable and in order
- Full duplex
	- bi-directional data flow in one connection
	- max segment size
- Cumulative ACKs
- Pipelining
	- Sending multiple packets at once
- Connection Oriented
- Flow controlled
	- set window size
Segment Structure
![[TCP Segment Table.png]]
Sequences and ACKs
- Sequence is the number that identifies how many bytes you've sent
- ACK is the acknowledgement that you got that sequence number
- 1 way example
	- I send a packet with sequence number 92
		- it has 8 bytes of data
		- I've just been a packet with sequence 50 so that's what I put in my ACK
	- You receive this packet
		- The packet you send back has sequence number 50, because your last packet had 0 bytes of data
		- Your acknowledgement is 100, because you're acknowledging you got all 8 bytes of information (92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99) 100 is the next expected byte
	- I receive this packet
		- My sequence is 100 now, I am sending 20 bytes of data
		- My ACK will still be 50 because I got sent 0 bytes of "data"
	- You receive this packet
		- Your new sequence is 50 because you are sending 0 bytes of data
		- your new ACK is 120, 100+20
- The thinking is the same for two way ACKs
Reliable data transfer
- When setting a timeout time
	- it shouldn't be shorter than RTT
	- but shouldn't be too long to cause slow responses
- SampleRTT is the time from sending the initial packet (even if there is a retransmission) to getting an ack back
$$\text{EstimatedRTT}_{n} = (1-\alpha)\times\text{EstimatedRTT}_{n-1}\times\alpha\times\text{SampleRTT}$$
-  The Estimated RTT takes the previous Estimated RTT and Sample RTT
	- Estimated RTT is a rolling average of all the estimated RTTs
	- SampleRTT is the real world value with timeouts and resends included
	- $\alpha$ alpha is the weighting we want to put to SampleRTT, typically set to 0.125
$$\text{TimeoutInterval}=\text{EstimatedRTT}+4\times\text{DevRTT}$$
+ This is the calculation used to set a reasonable timeout interval
$$\text{DevRTT}_{n}=(1-\beta)\times\text{DevRTT}_{n-1}+\beta\times\text|\text{SampleRTT}-\text{EstimatedRTT}|$$
- DevRTT is the deviation of EstimatedRTT
	- It's also a rolling average of all the deviations
	- The absolute value of the difference between SampleRTT and EstimatedRTT is how far the real RTT deviated from the rolling average of all real world RTTs so far
	- $\beta$ Beta is the weighting, usually set to 0.25
TCP Sender
- When data gets received from the application layer:
	- creates a segment with a sequence number
	- the sequence number is the byte-stream number of the first byte in data (what the example before went through)
	- start the TimeoutInterval timer
	- transmit
- When an ACK is received:
	- if ACK acknowledge previously unACKed segments
		- update what is known to be ACKed
		- start timer if there are still unACKed segments
- Timeout
	- retransmit the data that timed out
	- restart timer
TCP retransmission
- Timeout
	- pipelining example
		- I send you two packets at the same time
			- seq 92, len 8
			- seq 100, len 120
		- You send back ACKs
			- ACK 100
			- ACK 120
		- I don't receive first ACK in time
			- I resend first packet
		- I receive the ACKs
		- You receive duplicate first packet
			- send back ACK 120
- If you receive back an ACK of n, even if you don't get back n-1, you know that they received both n and n-1 packets
- If you instead receive ACK of n-1, you know that n hasn't been received
Flow Control
- In TCP segments, the amount of free buffer space is shown
- rwnd field
- RcvBuffer size is typically set to 4096 bytes
	- is auto adjusted by OS

Sequence Number formal definition
- byte-stream number of first byte
ACK number formal definition
- number of the next expected byte
note that the TCP spec doesn't have a protocol for out of order segments, it's up to the implementer

Connection Management
- Before exchanging information, a handshake is done
	- it agrees to establish the connection
	- agrees on the connection parameters
- TCP uses a 3-way handshake
	- I want to establish a connection so I send a request
		- SYNbit will be 1
		- Sequence number will be anything, so we'll just say x
	- You now receive my request so you send back a request acknowledgement
		- SYNbit will be 1
		- Sequence number will again be anything, let's say y
		- ACKbit will be 1
		- ACK number will be x+1
	- I receive your request acknowledgement so I will send back an acknowledgement
		- ACKbit will be 1
		- ACK will be y+1
		- Seq will be x+1 if we also send data back
- Closing a connection
	- I send a Finish packet
		- FINbit is 1
		- sequence number of whatever is may be at this point, let's say x
	- You receive the Finish packet and send back and Acknowledgement
		- ACKbit of 1
		- ACKnum of x+1
	- You then wait and send your own Finish bit
		- FINbit of 1
		- sequence of whatever it may be, let's say y
	- I get that packet and now I send you an ACK packet
		- ACKbit of 1
		- ACK of y+1
	- I wait for $2\times\text{TimeoutInterval}$
# Principles of congestion control
Congestion
- informal definition - "too many sources sending too much data too fast for network to handle"
- manifestations
	- long delays in router queues
	- packet loss, buffer overflow
- different from flow control
- When traffic increases in a router, delay increases and packet loss will occur
	- this will force retransmits
- To avoid this we start transmission at a low data rate and we slowly increase it

# TCP Congestion Control
- When a connection starts, send rate will increase exponentially until first packet loss
	- initially our send window (cwnd) is 1
	- we double this every RTT
	- so every ACK we receive we double
- There is a variable called ssthresh, it is 1/2 of the cwnd just before the first loss event
- When we get to ssthresh, we switch the increase to linear
- When we experience our first packet loss two things can happen depending on what TCP protocol we are using
	- TCP Tahoe - we set ssthresh to half of the cwnd, then set cwnd to 1
	- TCP Reno - we set ssthresh to half of the cwnd, then set cwnd to ssthresh + 1
- TCP AIMD
	- instead of the exponential increase we have a additive increase
		- cwnd starts at 10 as per [RFC 6928](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6928)
	- At each loss we half the current cwnd
	- AIMD has been shown to be the best method
$$\text{TCP rate}\approx\frac{\text{cwnd}}{\text{RTT}}\text{bytes/second}$$
- we ignore slow start when calculating average TCP rate
$$\text{Last Byte Sent}-\text{Last Byte ACKed}\le\text{cwnd}$$
$$W=cwnd$$
- W is window size
- average in-flight byte window size is $\frac{3}{4}W$
$$\text{avg. TCP thruput}=\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{\text{W}}{\text{RTT}}\text{bytes/second}$$
