R11)
$$\frac{L}{R1}+\frac{L}{R2}$$
a)
$$\frac{1500*8}{1*10^6}+\frac{1500*8}{2*10^6}=0.018\text{ seconds}$$
b)
$$\frac{1200*8}{3*10^6}+\frac{1200*8}{2*10^6}=0.008\text{ seconds}$$
P2)
$N\times P \times\frac{L}{R}$ where $x$ is the number of packets

P3)
a) because it's it's consistently sending information for a long time, a circuit switched network would be more reliable. Circuit switching doesn't suffer from things like buffer overflow. It allows this link between the sender and reciever to be more permanent.
b) No form of congestion control is needed, if the infrustructure can support x bits per second but your sending a chunk of information that is $x-y$ bits, it's like a hallway, the chunk of information can easily fit.

P4)
$$\frac{10000}{200}=50$$
b) 10% chance
c) $$^nC_{60}\times(0.1)^n\times(0.9)^{60-n}$$
