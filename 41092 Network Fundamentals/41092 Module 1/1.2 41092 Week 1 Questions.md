1.1
R1. An end system is a client. A web server could be an end system to another service but in the confines of the HTTP requests made from your phone, no. Phone, computer, tablet.
R2. VOIP, voice over internet protocol. Used for things like skype
R3. Standards are important to allow interoperability between different devices and services.

1.2
R4. DSL (home), Router (wireless), Switch (usually enterprise), ethernet (home and enterprise)
R5. HFC transmission rate is shared among users, all packets are from one source so no collisions are possible
R6. Wireless solutions like 4G, because one tower can reach impressive ranges when nothing blocking path. Satellites aren't as fast but can cover a much bigger area
R7. DSL uses higher frequencies to Dial Up
R8. Twister-pair copper wire, fiber optics
R9.

|  | HFC | DSL | FTTH |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Dedicated or Shared | Shared | Dedicated | shared |
| Transmission Rate | 10Gpbs | 100Mbps | 100Gbps |
R10.
4G - Part of Australia's mobile network, a 14 year old technology with speeds that are still comparable modern day. Coverage around Australia is really good unless you are in the middle of nowhere
5G - Part of Australia's mobile network, a 4 year old technology with really good speed (max of 5Gbps). This is because of it's use of millimetre wave though it makes it much more susceptible to solids and liquids.
WiFi - Allows routers to share internet with devices through the air. WiFi 7 has max speeds of 40Gbps and can automatically switch between it's frequencies to provide the best experience. WiFi only covers a few rooms though.
Each of these have important use cases in 2024

1.3
R11. L/R1+L/R2
R12. Circuit switch networks have less latency due to them allowing a path specifically for that application, no packets to wait on.
TDM has less distortion and less noise than FDM, therefore is able to handle data with greater efficiency.
R13. 
a. 5 users
b. Each user can use their full 1 megabit or data with 2 users, but if all 3 users send data at the same time, 3 megabits will need transferring at once
c. 20% chance of transmitting
d. 
$(0.2+0.8)^3$ 
where all three users are transmitting, therefore we need the term with $(0.2)^3$
$$^1C_3\times(0.2)^3\times(0.8)^0=0.08$$
Therefore, there is a 0.8% chance of all three users sending data at once

R14. Allows traffic to go between ISPs directly, allows reduction in costs for both parties, improved performance, higher level of routing control, enhanced redundancy and a competitive advantage
IXPs earn money by charging for traffic and government grants
R15. Content Providers need a completely different expertise to ISPs. Large storage farm, large processing power, etc. It allows ISPs to focus on infrastructure and content providers to focus on delivering content.
Content providers tend to peer with ISP while smaller Content Providers will piggy back off of CDNs or use Transit Providers. This allows for larger Content Providers to get really cheap bulk rates while smaller Content Providers can get a somewhat affordable rate for their content delivery.
