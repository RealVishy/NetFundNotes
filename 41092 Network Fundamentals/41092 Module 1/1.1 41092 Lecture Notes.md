### What is a Network
- Access network
	- wireless and wired connection to a router
- Network Core
	- ISP
- Connecting router to end systems
	- central hubs in every suburb/town
- shared and dedicated technologies
	- shared will impact transmission with amt of users
	- dedicated gives users lines that are independent of others
	- Screeching dial up tones were because dial up used voice
	- We are now able to use higher frequencies

### Basic Route
Router - DSLAM - ISP
- modern last mile connections are dedicated because it's one line into your house connecting to one
- HFC - Hybrid Fiber Coax
- John Whatson
	- Used Coaxial cable to transfer his good antenna connection to neighbours
	- HFC is the largest last mile solution in major cities
- Splitters split different signals at the home
	- Used to do voice and data
	- Now splits video and data
- Line from CMTS to street is shared, because we need to split up data based on who should get it
- Modem - Router - Wireless Access Point (usually built into one)
- Enterprise Networks
	- Last Mile technology usually is direct fibre
	- helps support institute web and mail servers

### Physical Media
- Links: physical media
	- guided media - wired connections
	- unguided media - wireless technology
**Guided:**
- Twister pair
	- CAT 6/ethernet
	- twisted pair of insulated wires 
- Coaxial cable
	- two concentric copper conductors
	- bi directional
	- broadband:
	- multiple frequency channels each cable
- Fibre optic cable
	- glass fibre, carries light
	- very high speed, 100s gigabytes
	- long distances
	- can have hundreds of fibres close together
**Unguided**
- signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
- half-duplex, only one way
- terrestrial microwave
	- 45Mbps
- Wireless LAN (WiFi)
	- up to 100s of Mbps
- Wide Area
	- 4G/5G
- Satellite
	- ~ 45Mbps per channel
	- large delay

DSLAM
- bank of modems in exchange that receives information from every individual modem
CMTS
- provide high speed data services

### Network Core
- packets, a way to chunk up data you need to send
- packet transmission delay, L(bits)/R(bits/sec)
- If arrival rate exceed transmission rate, excess is stored in buffer, loss happens when buffer is full
- Key Functions:
	- Routing
	- Forwarding table
![[Routing Table vs Forwarding Table.png]]
- Circuit switching - give dedicated channels
	- FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing (analogue signals)
	- TDM - Time Division Multiplexing
- Packet switching - shares the cable using packets and buffers
	- resource sharing
	- no call setup
	- pack delay and loss
		- protocols will need to be reliable

**Internet Structure**
- IXP - Internet Exchange Point
	- Links ISPs and CDNs together
- POP - Point of Prescence
	- Network interface between entities

- What Access technologies are used in NBN? 
- What is FTTH? 
- What are the data rates for each technology? 
- How much $ are they? 
- Discuss Pros and Cons for each

Why is line sharing difficult to understand?
