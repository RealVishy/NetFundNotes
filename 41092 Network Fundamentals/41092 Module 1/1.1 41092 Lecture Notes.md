### What is a Network
- Access network
	- wireless and wired connection to a router
- Network Core
	- ISP
- Connecting router to end systems
	- central hubs in every suburb/town
- shared and dedicated technologies
	- shared will impact transmission with amt of users
	- dedicated gives users lines that are independent of others
	- Screeching dial up tones were because dial up used voice
	- We are now able to use higher frequencies

### Basic Route
Router - DSLAM - ISP
- modern last mile connections are dedicated because it's one line into your house connecting to one
- HFC - Hybrid Fiber Coax
- John Whatson
	- Used Coaxial cable to transfer his good antenna connection to neighbours
	- HFC is the largest last mile solution in major cities
- Splitters split different signals at the home
	- Used to do voice and data
	- Now splits video and data
- Line from CMTS to street is shared, because we need to split up data based on who should get it
- Modem - Router - Wireless Access Point (usually built into one)
- Enterprise Networks
	- Last Mile technology usually is direct fibre
	- helps support institute web and mail servers

### Physical Media
- Links: physical media
	- guided media - wired connections
	- unguided media - wireless technology
**Guided:**
- Twister pair
	- CAT 6/ethernet
	- twisted pair of insulated wires 
- Coaxial cable
	- two concentric copper conductors
	- bi directional
	- broadband:
	- multiple frequency channels each cable
- Fibre optic cable
	- glass fibre, carries light
	- very high speed, 100s gigabytes
	- long distances
	- can have hundreds of fibres close together
**Unguided**
- signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
- half-duplex, only one way
- terrestrial microwave
	- 45Mbps
- Wireless LAN (WiFi)
	- up to 100s of Mbps
- Wide Area
	- 4G/5G
- Satellite
	- ~ 45Mbps per channel
	- large delay

DSLAM
- bank of modems in exchange that receives information from every individual modem
CMTS
- provide high speed data services

### Network Core
- packets, a way to chunk up data you need to send
- packet transmission delay, L(bits)/R(bits/sec)
- If arrival rate exceed transmission rate, excess is stored in buffer, loss happens when buffer is full
- Key Functions:
	- Routing
	- Forwarding table

*(We don't need to know what a routing table is now, but I thought I would include it!)*
Routing Table
- Process of finding the path between two networks based on their network addresses
- Used by routers to forward traffic from one network to another
- Stores the destination addresses for networks
- Concentrates on calculating changes in topology
Forwarding Table
- Process of sending network data to its destination port
- Used by devices such as switches or bridges that are able to process packets faster
- Responsible for storing the next hop of each network and the frame type
- Concentrate on improving the process of finding an address when forwarding a packet that has additional information such as a MAC address

- Circuit switching - give dedicated channels
	- FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing (analogue signals)
	- TDM - Time Division Multiplexing
- Packet switching - shares the cable using packets and buffers
	- resource sharing
	- no call setup
	- pack delay and loss
		- protocols will need to be reliable

**Internet Structure**
- IXP - Internet Exchange Point
	- Links ISPs and CDNs together
- POP - Point of Prescence
	- Network interface between entities

- What Access technologies are used in NBN? 
Hybrid Fibre Coaxial, Fibre Optic
- What is FTTH? 
Fibre to the home, where they run a Fibre Optic cable into the home
- What are the data rates for each technology? 
Hybrid Fibre Coaxial is a max of about 100 Mbps, while Fibre Optic allows for speeds of upwards of 10Gbps (can go much higher in other use cases, but for NBN this is around the limit)
- How much $ are they? 
*(don't really know what this is asking? is it looking for an exact price? Prices of the plans or the wires themselves? Just know that Fibre is expensive)*
- Discuss Pros and Cons for each
Coaxial cables are a hell of a lot cheaper but have much less bandwidth
Fibre Optic cables have a much greater bandwidth but are inhibitively expensive and are much more fragile.

Why is line sharing difficult to understand?
Because of the amount of added complexity when it comes to line sharing, the protocols, the different technologies and the jargon needed to understand anything.
